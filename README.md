## Training the Model

### Data Preparation

Example:
```
The dataset used for training is the OpenAI GPT-4o dataset, which can be accessed via the paid version OpenAI API.
If you can't access the GPT-4o dataset, you can use the free version of GPT-3 via OpenAI API.
And if you want to upload your own files, please save it as a CSV file.
```

### Training
Describe the training process and parameters.

Example:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

---

## Evaluation

### Metrics
List the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance.

Example:
```
Accuracy: 85%
F1-Score: 0.90
```

### Testing
Explain how to test the AI model after training.

Example:
```bash
python test.py --model saved_model.pth
```
