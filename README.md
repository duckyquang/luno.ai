## Installation

### Prerequisites
- List the dependencies and tools required (e.g., Python, libraries, GPU support, etc.).
```
Python 3.8+
PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model)
```

### Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/duckyquang/luno.ai
cd luno.ai
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

---

## Usage

### Running the AI
Provide instructions on how to run the AI or use its features.

Example:
```bash
python main.py --mode interact
```

### API Usage
If your AI provides an API:
```
POST /api/v1/predict
Body: {
  "input": "How can I help you today?"
}
```

---

## Model Details

### Model Architecture
Provide a description of the model architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer).

Example:
```
This AI is built using the GPT-3 architecture, which is a transformer-based model optimized for NLP tasks such as text generation and comprehension.
```

### Pre-trained Models
Link to any pre-trained models you are using or offer instructions on how to download them.
